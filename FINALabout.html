        Hi! My name is James, I'm 19, my Birthday is 3/27, <br> I love spending time with animals. I'm very fond of coding as you can probably tell. <u>Ideally, I would like to go into game developement.</u> <br><br>
        I've wanted to build video games ever since I was a kid, specifically, RPGS, I was mostly inspired by the Pokemon Series, Undertale, and Deltarune, among others <br><br>
       Many would describe my personality as bubbly. I am a great listener. <br><br>Some of hobbies include photography, videography, gaming, skating, hiking, dancing, cooking & baking. <br> <br> 
       Besides the computer science industry, I would like to go into acting, directing, scripting, stage crew, etc.

In High School, I was honored to be on my schoolâ€™s Morning Show, M-Dub TV. I have skills in Videography, Photography as well as working cooperatively with a team.
<br><br>
During this time, I dyed my hair a whole rainbow of colors, I loved when my hair was green because that was my favorite color, but it was always a problem when we'd need to film me over a greenscreen, lol! So I ended up editing a lot
